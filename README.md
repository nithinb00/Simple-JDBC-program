# Simple-JDBC-program
This is a simple Movies JDBC program done with the help of Netbeans and SqLite.
So In this program I have provided you with the required textfields to enter the details of a particular movie.i.e Movie name, actor, actress, director, year of release.
So you can enter the data to the Sql table through these textfields provided.
Another textfield is given at the bottom labelled as "Enter the actor". So when we enter the name of the actor inside this textfield and when we press the "show data" button, it will filter out the movies corresponding to the actor provided. This result is printed atn the print console provided in the Netbeans using "System.out.print"
